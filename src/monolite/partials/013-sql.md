title: Generic SQL
category: Persistence

Besides the default H2 implementation, there's a [generic SQL](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-sql) `DAO` plugin
which adds support for all the major RDBMS - MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and SQLite.
The class `SqlDAO` implements the `DAO` interface is responsible for connecting to an SQL server at a given URL.
All database connections are managed by [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) - a lightweight,
production-ready, JDBC connection pool.

Before you can use this plugin, you need to find an download the right driver for your database. This is a small package
which must be loaded from the classpath along with the plugin and the HikariCP library. You also have to specify the
class name of the loaded driver in the main Para configuration file. For SQLite the JDBC driver is bundled with the
plugin so it just works.

There are several configuration properties for this plugin (these go in your `application.conf` file):

<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>property</th>
			<th>description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>

`para.sql.driver`</td><td> The fully-qualified class name for your SQL driver. Defaults to `null`.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>

`para.sql.url`</td><td> The server URL to connect to, *without* the `jdbc:` prefix. Defaults to `null`.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>

`para.sql.user`</td><td> The username with access to the database. Defaults to `user`.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>

`para.sql.password`</td><td> The DB password. Defaults to `secret`.</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The plugin is on Maven Central. Here's the Maven snippet to include in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.erudika</groupId>
  <artifactId>para-dao-sql</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively you can [download the JAR](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-sql/releases) and put it in a
`lib` folder alongside the server JAR file `para-x.y.z.jar`. Para will look for plugins inside `lib` and pick up
the plugin.

> **Important:** Except for SQLite, you must download the appropriate JDBC driver package for your database and
put it in the `lib/` folder.

Then you have to set the `loader.path=lib` system property in order to make the Spring Boot launcher add that folder
to the classpath. For example:
```
java -jar -Dconfig.file=./application.conf -Dloader.path=lib  para.jar
```

Here's an example configuration for this plugin (these go inside your `application.conf`):
```ini
para.sql.driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
para.sql.url = "mysql://localhost:3306"
para.sql.user = "user"
para.sql.password = "secret"
```
Finally, set the config property:
```ini
para.dao = "SqlDAO"
```
This could be a Java system property or part of a `application.conf` file on the classpath.
This tells Para to use the SQL DAO implementation instead of the default.

SQLite, for example, has the simplest configuration:
```ini
para.sql.driver = "org.sqlite.JDBC"
para.sql.url = "sqlite:/home/user/para.db"
```

The environment variable `para.sql.url` is required and provides the URL to connect to the SQL database.
The SQL DAO uses JDBC and will prefix your URL with the JDBC protocol, so you don't need to include the JDBC
protocol in your URL path. For example, to connect to a MySQL server with URL `mysql://localhost:3306`,
the SQL DAO will prefix this URL with the JDBC protocol to form the full URL `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306`.

The URL you specify should also include in it's path the database to be used by Para. The SQL DAO will not
automatically create a **database** for you (though Para _does_ create **tables** within your database automatically),
so you must use an existing database. For example, you cannot simply specify the URL to your MySQL cluster/server
(`mysql://localhost:3306`), but rather you need to specify the path to an existing database
(`mysql://localhost:3306/para`). Note that the user name and password you provide with `para.sql.user` and
`para.sql.password` should correspond to the specific database you specify in the URL, and that user should have
complete permissions within that database.


### Using a JDBC Driver

The SQL DAO uses JDBC to connect to your SQL database, which means a SQL driver (java.sql.Driver) will be needed for
your chosen flavor of SQL (for example, `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` is used for MySQL).  You must specify the
fully-qualified class name for your SQL driver. Upon initialization, the SQL DAO will attempt to load this driver
and verify that it exists in the classpath. If the driver cannot be found, the SQL DAO will fail to initiailize and
the DAO cannot be used.

In addition to specifying the driver name, you need to ensure the JAR file containing the SQL driver corresponding to
your database is on your classpath when launching Para Server. The easiest way to do this is to add your SQL driver's
JAR file to the `lib/` directory relative to the location of the Para Server WAR file `para-x.y.z.war`.

### Working with Oracle database

To use Oracle DB you need to create a user (schema) for Para, with `CREATE SESSION` and `CREATE TABLE` privileges.
You also need to enable writes on the USERS tablespace if you get an error like
`ora-01950: no privileges on tablespace 'users'`.

```sql
CREATE USER para IDENTIFIED BY <password>;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE TO para;
ALTER USER para quota unlimited on USERS;
```

Then the configuration will look something like this:
```ini
para.sql.driver = "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"
para.sql.url = "oracle:thin:@127.0.0.1:1521/XE"
para.sql.user = "para"
para.sql.password = "secret"
```

If you are have a `sysdba/sysoper` type of user, you can set `para.sql.user = "para as sysdba"`.
The plugin has been tested with the Express edition of Oracle 18c database.

### Schema

> **BREAKING CHANGE:** The schema has changed in v1.30.0 - columns `timestamp` and `updated` were removed,
column `json_updates` was added. `H2DAO` attempts to apply these changes automatically or error, but `SqlDAO` does not.

**Execute the following statements one after another before switching to the new version:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE {app_identifier} DROP COLUMN timestamp, updated;
ALTER TABLE {app_identifier} ADD json_updates NVARCHAR;
```
This is not required for tables created after v1.30.0.

Here's the schema for each table created by Para:
```sql
CREATE TABLE {app_identifier} (
    id						NVARCHAR NOT NULL,
    type					NVARCHAR,
    name					NVARCHAR,
    parentid			NVARCHAR,
    creatorid			NVARCHAR,
    json					NVARCHAR,
    json_updates	NVARCHAR
)
```
