In the package `com.erudika.para.core` there are a number of core domain classes that are used throughout Para.
These are common classes like `User` and `App` which you can use in you application directly or extend them.
You can use them for your objects but you're always free to create your own. To do that, simply `POST` a new object
with `type: mytype` through the API and your new type will be automatically registered.

**Note:** Type definitions *cannot* contain the symbols `/` and `#`.

### Voting

Para implements a simple voting mechanism for objects - each object can be voted up and down an has a `votes` property.
Voting is useful for many application which require sorting by user votes. When a vote is cast, a new object of type
`Vote` is created to store the vote in the database. Users have a configurable time window to amend their vote, they can
no longer vote on that particular object.
